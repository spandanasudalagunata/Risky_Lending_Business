# Risky_Lending_Business
The global goal in this project is the maximization of return-on-investment on the issuance of small dollar loans. This global goal is supported through the accomplishment of two supporting goals: Determining the probability of default (PD), and loss given default (LgD), of every applicant. It is critical to determine LgD, or credit loss when extreme events occur influencing the debtor’s ability to repay debts. This term has a very high predictive value into the providing credit and the recovery process due to its direct impact on capital savings.
 
The successful accomplishment of these two supporting goals enable the team to compare the financial risk and opportunity of each applicant and make strategic decisions about lending based on the team’s risk tolerance. We hope that our group’s efforts will contribute to the understanding of the predictive nature and usefulness in studying the determinants of loan/credit recovery through a variety of analytical logistical and regressive multivariate models on a very large dataset.  The reliability of results will be verified through the use of the AUC and Accuracy Ratio.
